# Line Following Robot - Arduino Project 

## Introduction

## Equipment 
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 2 DC Motors
* 3 QTI Infrared Sensors
* 1 Ultrasonic Sensor
* 1 L293d Motor Driver Chip

## Circuit Diagram 

Below is the diagram representing the circuit I built for the three sensors. The circuit is powered by two 9-volt batteries connected in series. One 9-volt battery failed to supply enough current, so two were required.
